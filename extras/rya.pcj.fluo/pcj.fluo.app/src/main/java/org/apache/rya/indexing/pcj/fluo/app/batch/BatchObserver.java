/**
 * BatchObserver processes tasks that need to be broken into batches. Entries
 * stored stored in this {@link FluoQueryColumns#BATCH_COLUMN} are of the form
 * Row: nodeId, Value: BatchInformation. The nodeId indicates the node that the
 * batch operation will be performed on. All batch operations are performed on
 * the bindingSet column for the {@link NodeType} corresponding to the given
 * nodeId. For example, if the nodeId indicated that the NodeType was
 * StatementPattern, then the batch operation would be performed on
 * {@link FluoQueryColumns#STATEMENT_PATTERN_BINDING_SET}. This Observer applies
 * batch updates to overcome the restriction that all Fluo transactions are processed
 * in memory. This allows the Rya Fluo application to process large tasks that cannot
 * fit into memory in a piece-wise, batch fashion.
